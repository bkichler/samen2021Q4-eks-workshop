# Configure, deploy, and see how far you get

## A possible approach:
  1. Start with the [**dashboard**](/samen/040_dashboard) module
  2. Continue with [**deployment**](/samen/050_deploy) of some basic workloads
  3. Work through [**a basic Helm use case**](/samen/060_helm)
  4. See what you can do with [**a Spark deployment to k8s**](/samen/061_spark)  
  **OR**...  
  Skip Spark and focus on better configuration of your EKS cluster via [**RBAC**](/samen/090_rbac) and [**IAM**](/samen/091_iam-groups)
  5. Try to [**expose a service**](/samen/130_exposing-service)

Anything beyond that is up to you and the time you have remaining!
